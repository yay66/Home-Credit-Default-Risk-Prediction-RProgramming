# Home-Credit-Default-Risk-Kaggle-Featured-Prediction-Competition
A machine learning model for predicting the possibility of default risk for Home Credit clients.

-	Engineered nine distinct features focusing on key financial ratios and demographic details to improve the model performance.
-	Utilized GGplot2, Plotly, Dplyr, and Corrplot to execute EDA on 307,511 loan applications with 122 initial features. Deployed heatmap to discern variables influencing loan risk assessments, curating the dataset by excising non-contributory variables.
-	Resolved dataset imbalance challenges by implementing the Threshold Adjustment technique and XG-Boosting algorithm.
